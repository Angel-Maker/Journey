    <string name="about_app_what_is_journey_title">What is Journey? </string>
    <string name="about_app_what_is_journey_content">Journey is a scheduling app
        designed to help with develop skills or make progress on personal projects. </string>

    <string name="about_app_concept_title">Concept </string>
    <string name="about_app_concept_content">Almost everyone at some point has tried to develop a skill but dropped it for some reason.
        Maybe because life got complicated and there wasn\'t enough time for a while. Maybe because you had a specific goal you were
        trying to reach but got discouraged on the way.Journey was designed to keep you working on the skill and does so in two ways.

        \n\n1.Daily activity checkmarks to encourage not skipping days.
        \n2.A change in perspective from trying to reach a goal, to trying to improving a skill.

    <string name="about_app_getting_started_title">Getting started </string>
    <string name="about_app_getting_started_content">1.Open the options menu in the top right of the main screen.\n
        2.Select the “Manage Journeys” option.\n
        3.Select “Start a new Journey”.\n
        4.Fill out the information and submit.\n
        5.Return to the main menu.

        \n\nEvery day that you meet your goal you can select that day and check it off. It is strongly encouraged to take
        a picture, video,  make a note of your progress for the day and attach it to the activity you just checked off
        as well. Once you get to the last day of your journey, a new option will appear on the main menu to look back
        on all the progress you have made.

    <string name="about_app_recommendations_title">Activity recommendations </string>
    <string name="about_app_recommendations_content">You can select any type of activity and set any type of goal per day but the following
        are some recommendations that may improve experience with the app. Pick activities that you have some way of recording progress such
        as drawing and attach each picture you draw, running and create a text file with the distance you ran, or music and record yourself
        playing. Keep the activities short so you can’t excuse yourself from it by thinking you don’t have time. Try to keep the activities
        to under 10 minutes. When selecting a period of time, choose a day far enough in the future that you can see your improvement. Try 6
        month or a year. If the activity involves a tool or location that you don’t always have access to, think of a backup action that would
        still help make progress with the skill such as reading guides.
